  <h1>Cold baths 'ease aching muscles, but may be risky'</h1>

<br>
<p> <b> Taking a cold bath after exercise can soothe sore muscles but it is unclear whether this is safe, say experts. </b> Plunging into chilly water can provide a shock to the system and may even be harmful, researchers at the UK Cochrane Centre warn. </p>

<p> After looking at available trial evidence - 17 small studies involving 366 people - they say there is not enough evidence to back the technique. There may well be other better ways to ease muscular aches, they suggest. This might include a spot of light jogging or a dip in a warm bath, they say. </p>

<p> The idea behind submerging the muscles in icy water, sometimes referred to as cryotherapy, is to reduce swelling and the associated stiffness and soreness that comes with working the muscles hard. </p>

<p> In the studies that the Cochrane team looked at, participants were asked to get into a bath or container of cold water after running, cycling or resistance training. Lead researcher Dr Chris Bleakley, of the University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, said: "We found some evidence that immersing yourself in cold water after exercise can reduce muscle soreness, but only compared to resting or doing nothing." </p>

<p> But there were too few studies that compared cold baths with other interventions to say that it is the best strategy for sore limbs. <b> And safety concerns remain unanswered. <b> Dr Bleakley said: "It is important to consider that cold water immersion induces a degree of shock on the body. We need to be sure that people aren't doing anything harmful, especially if they are exposing themselves to very cold water for long periods."</p>
